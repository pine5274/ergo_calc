Use the Watts Calculator to determine your power in watts based on your average pace per 500 meters.

Alternatively, enter your watts to determine your average pace per 500 meters.

Formulas Used
2.80 is a constant used in both formulas. The formulas used are:

watts = 2.80/pace³
pace = ³√(2.80/watts)
where pace is time in seconds over distance in meters.

For example: a 2:05/500m split = 125 seconds/500 meters or a 0.25 pace. Watts are then calculated as (2.80/0.25 ^ 3) or (2.80/0.015625), which equals 179.2.
